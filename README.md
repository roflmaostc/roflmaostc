## Felix Wechsler

I'm currently working on computational optics topics such as 3D printing with light or wave propagation. Feel free to visit my [webpage](https://felixwechsler.science/) for more information.

A lot of my work is implemented in [Julia Lang](https://julialang.org/). I mainly use [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) + [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/) + [Vim](https://www.vim.org/).


## Scientific Code
* [Scalable Angular Spectrum](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/Scalable-Angular-Spectrum-Method-SAS) for optical wave propagation.

## Julia Lang
Some of my larger packages:

* [ABCDMatrixOptics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPhysics/ABCDMatrixOptics.jl) to trace Geometrical and Gaussian beams with matrices
* [DeconvOptim.jl](https://github.com/roflmaostc/DeconvOptim.jl) for performant data deconvolution
* [DiffImageRotation.jl](https://github.com/roflmaostc/DiffImageRotation.jl) for CUDA, differentiable image rotation
* [FourierTools.jl](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/FourierTools.jl) to efficiently work with Fourier space
* [IndexFunArrays](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/IndexFunArrays.jl) to create arrays according to index specific behaviour
* [NDTools.jl](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/NDTools.jl) to manage N dimensional data
* [Noise.jl](https://github.com/roflmaostc/Noise.jl) to degrade data quality
* [PtyLab.jl](https://github.com/PtyLab/PtyLab.jl) to reconstruct Ptychography datasets
* [RadonKA.jl](https://github.com/roflmaostc/RadonKA.jl) for (exponential/attenuated) Radon transforms
* [WaveOpticsPropagation.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPhysics/WaveOpticsPropagation.jl) for differentiable wave optical propagation

Outdated:
* [PhysicalOptics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPhysics/PhysicalOptics.jl) to simulate wave optics


## Python
* [orpheuscc](https://www.orpheus-verein.de) to manage event registrations of the Orpheus e.V. Written in Python + Django
* [Naive implementation](https://github.com/roflmaostc/Fast-Approximate-Energy-Minimization-via-Graph-Cuts) of energy minimization with graph cuts. 

## OCaml
* [PONGCaml](https://github.com/roflmaostc/PONGCaml) simple and easy pong game written in OCaml
* Solved almost all [99 OCaml problems](https://github.com/roflmaostc/99-OCaml-Problems)

## Toy projects
* [aiornot.fun](https://github.com/roflmaostc/aiornot.fun): A quiz to test your knowledge whether you're able to idenfity an AI paper or non AI paper.
