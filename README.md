## Felix Wechsler

I'm currently working on computational optics topics. Feel free to visit my [webpage](https://felixwechsler.science/) for more information.

A lot of my previous work was implemented in JuliaLang. I mainly use [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) + [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/) + [Vim](https://www.vim.org/).

[![Felix's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=roflmaostc)](https://github.com/roflmaostc/github-readme-stats)


## Julia Lang
Some of my larger packages:
* [DeconvOptim.jl](https://github.com/roflmaostc/DeconvOptim.jl) for performant data deconvolution
* [FourierTools.jl](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/FourierTools.jl) to efficiently work with Fourier space
* [NDTools.jl](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/NDTools.jl) to manage N dimensional data 
* [PtyLab.jl](https://github.com/PtyLab/PtyLab.jl) to reconstruct Ptychography datasets
* [Noise.jl](https://github.com/roflmaostc/Noise.jl) to degrade your data quality
* [IndexFunArrays](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/IndexFunArrays.jl) to create arrays according to index specific behaviour

Kind of outdated:
* [PhysicalOptics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPhysics/PhysicalOptics.jl) to simulate wave optics


## Python
* [orpheuscc](www.orpheus-verein.de) to manage event registrations of the Orpheus e.V. Written in Python + Django
* [Naive implementation](https://github.com/roflmaostc/Fast-Approximate-Energy-Minimization-via-Graph-Cuts) of energy minimization with graph cuts. 

## OCaml
* [PONGCaml](https://github.com/roflmaostc/PONGCaml) simple and easy pong came written in OCaml
* Solved almost all [99 OCaml problems](https://github.com/roflmaostc/99-OCaml-Problems)
